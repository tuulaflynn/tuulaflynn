## About me
I'm Tuula and this is my GitHub page where I've shared some of the projects I've worked on. I'm a first-class graduate in mathematics from the University of Leeds and a trainee software developer at Wiley Edge. Prior to this position with Wiley Edge, I completed a full stack software engineering bootcamp with HyperionDev, achieving 99% in it. 

I am excited to work on future projects with more collaborators, larger technological stacks, and bigger objectives.
